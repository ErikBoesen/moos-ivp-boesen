In this lab, the goal appears to be that our simulated robot traverse an area with a temperature variance front generated through a simple waveform equation. We can provide various parameters to this equation in order to affect how it will be shaped and its behavior. The goal of our activities with the robot is to determine the properties of the waveform by traversing across the terrain. The math behind doing this is relatively complicated: we must determine based on data gathered while the robot is moving in a lawnmower pattern and the front is moving as well.
